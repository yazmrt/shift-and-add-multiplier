# shift-and-add-multiplier
Shift and add multiplier that uses only one FA for the addition process.
The codes are in the source file.
The used algorithm can be found in the SSCE pdf file.
The max frequency for 8*8 multiplication is 438 Mhz.
There is a possibility that the design can be run faster if I use binary encoding in state machines. The current encoding is one hot encoding.
